# Space-time smoothing models for subnational measles routine immunization coverage estimation with complex survey data

Here are some example R code for the analyses and visualizations in "Space-time smoothing models for subnational measles routine immunization coverage estimation with complex survey data" by Dong and Wakefield (2021) (https://doi.org/10.1214/21-aoas1474).

- *s1_data_clean.R*: code for data cleaning. 

- *s2_get_dir_est.R*: code for obtaining design-based direct estimates of overall vaccination coverage.

- *s3_fit_model.R*: code for fitting space-time smoothing models.

- *s4_model_summ.R*: code for plotting maps of posterior summary statistics of the model results.
